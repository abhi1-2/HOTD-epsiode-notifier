### DESCRIPTION

I originally made this script to notify me when Hose of the Dragon episodes drop but with simple modifications i was able to do the same for any show .
#### NOTE: 
This uses m4uhd.cc to scrape results . Also currently script compatible with mac only

### HOW TO USE

1. Clone the project on your system (mac)
2. Open the script.py file and make the following changes -

    1.  Change the m4uhd_link to the show of your preference (the link must be a valid m4uhd.cc link)
    2.  In the episode_no variable add the episode no. you want to be notified about (integer value)
    3.  Then simply open your terminal and run the script.py file as follows - 
    
    ```python
    python3 script.py
    ```
